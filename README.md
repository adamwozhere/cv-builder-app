# CV Builder App

A prototype CV builder application created for my final project at Bath Spa Web Development Bootcamp.
While learning React, I decided to use Vanilla JavaScript to strengthen my fundementals before learning front-end libraries.
I created it using a componentized architecture by using seperate files and template literals for rendering HTML - this ended up quite similar in concept to React. Managing state was a challenge; I used `LocalStorage` to handle this, capturing changes from the html forms when data is changed. This works and means there doesn't need to be a save function, however it's not optimised as it loops through all the form elements. In doing this project, I can see why libraries are vital for more complicated projects.
